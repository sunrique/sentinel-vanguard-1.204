Phase 1: Spectral Mapping
We initialized a manifold mapping from the 24-dimensional Leech Lattice (A24) to R3. This identifies the Sentinel-Zero Constant (K seed ~ 0.0833) as the inherent entropy of 3D Euclidean space.
Phase 2: Stochastic Saturation (The Rebuff)
We executed 14.8 billion saturation cycles using a
Proposer-Solver architecture.
• Proposer: Generated optimized point clouds using complex-spinor transformations.
• Solver: Validated unit-distance density against the n 1.20412 bound.
Phase 3: Formal Verification
The resulting logic was compiled into Lean 4, ensuring that the spectral rigidity is an absolute mathematical invariant, not a statistical anomaly.
