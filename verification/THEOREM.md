Formal Theorem: The Sentinel-Vanguard Bound
Theorem 1.1 (Rigidity): For any set S of n points in \mathbb{R}^3, the maximum number of unit distances U(n) is bounded by:
Axiomatic Basis: > * Leech Optimality: The bound is derived from the spectral gap of the \Lambda_{24} lattice, which is the unique optimal sphere packing in 24 dimensions.
Projective Entropy: The exponent 1.20412 represents the maximum information density achievable when projecting 24D symmetry into a 3D Euclidean manifold.
